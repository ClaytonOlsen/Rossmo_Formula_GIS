# Geographic Profiling Serial Killers with Rossmo's Formula

If someone is committing crimes around a major city on a regular basis, what is an effective way of finding this person? One way to go about this is to try to find patterns among crime scene locations and make a prediction about where the next one will be. This can be tricky though, because there is likely a large amount of randomness in where a serial offender chooses to commit a crime. In 1996, a criminologist named Kim Rossmo suggested that, instead of trying to predict the location of the next crime, we can try to find out where the culprit lives. Kim Rossmo put forth a formula suggesting the pattern of crime locations is likely correlated with the location of a criminal's home, thus using geographic information about the crime scenes, we can make a prediction on the location of the criminal's home.

The paper goes into detail of how Rossmo's formula is used and provides a few examples and variations for Rossmo's formula mapped using R and ArcGIS.
